# Snake Walls using PYgame
---------------------------
This python file is a spin on the classic game snake. The score is on the top left corner where one gains a point by eating the food that randomly spawns. In this version of the game, walls randomly spawn. If the player runs the snake into the wall the game will restart and the score will be set to zero.
